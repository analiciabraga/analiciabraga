### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ana LÃ­cia
#### I am a Cybersecurity Specialist

Public servant in transition to the private market. Passionate about solving puzzles, I am also fascinated by programming and its aspects, currently bitten by the Python snake, but there is always room for new languages â€‹â€‹and new knowledge.
UNINTER Global Ambassador (Global Student Ambassadors), 2020-2021, mentored by Jason Dyett (Founding Executive Director of the Harvard University office in Brazil between 2006-2016), I always try to bring my best to help work teams, always with the ethics and competence that I consider essential in any work I do.

Skills: PHP / C++ / Python / HTML / CSS
